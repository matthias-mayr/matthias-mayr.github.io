summary: A workshop designed to enable the ROS community to try out different deliberation technologies
abstract: 'The workshop offers hands-on exploration of task planning and behavior modeling within ROS 2. Participants engage in solving robotics problems using various task planning and behavior definition technologies including Behavior Trees, Hierarchical Finite-State Machines, Task Planning, and Verification and Validation. Expert moderators will guide participants through the implementation process, ensuring ample opportunity for understanding and hands-on practice with each technology. The schedule is balanced to allow sufficient time for introductory presentations, hands-on implementation sessions moderated by maintainers of the respective technologies - BehaviorTree.CPP, FlexBE, SkiROS2, and the CONVINCE toolchain - and interactive discussions. This way, attendees will have the chance to compare and contrast the different deliberation technologies, gaining insights into their practical applications and nuances.'
