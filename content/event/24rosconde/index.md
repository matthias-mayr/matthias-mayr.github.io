summary: In many robotics applications, it is important to be flexible and to automatically adapt the execution of processes to the current situation. One way to make this possible is explicit knowledge representation. This article provides an overview of the tools available for knowledge modelling in ROS and shows practical examples using the SkiROS2 platform.
