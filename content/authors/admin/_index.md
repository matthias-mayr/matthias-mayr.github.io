      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am interested in making robotic systems intelligent and efficient. Throughout my life I have touched many aspects of robotic systems from navigation, to controller development, reinforcement learning and task-level planning. I develop and maintain a wide variety of software repositories, all centered around robotics.

I worked both in academia and industry, having worked for companies like Bosch or Siemens as well as for startups like RiACT. As an academic education I have PhD degree from Lund University, Sweden and an engineering education from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe with a strong focus on robotics, system- and software engineering. 

With my company I am bringing skill-based robotics to the European industries. I offer to combine modern robotics together with knowledge representation and efficient machine learning.
Contact me for robotics projects, freelancing opportunities or collaborations.
<!-- In my research, I combine high-level AI methods with machine-learning techniques such as reinforcement learning to enable efficient learning of robust and explainable policies. I enabled contact-rich manufacturing tasks with manipulators and that require compliant control. -->
